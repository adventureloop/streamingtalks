This directory contains the source for the slides given at EuroBSDCon 2018 and
a render of the final slides. If you just wish to view the slides clone this
repo and open eurobsdcon2018-streamingtalks.html in a web browser.

The slides incorporate many diagrams written in ascii art, these diagrams must
be rendered using goat available here: https://github.com/blampe/goat

A python script render.py handles merging the remark.js slide source with
rendered svg graphics.
